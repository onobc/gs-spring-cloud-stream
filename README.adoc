== Getting Started with Spring Cloud Stream
This guide walks you through an overview of Spring Cloud Stream and the process of creating an event-driven
streaming application.

=== What is Spring Cloud Stream?
A framework for building event-driven Spring Boot microservices for real-time stream processing. You can learn more about
the framework from the link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream[project-site],
link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream#learn[documentation],
and link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[samples].

=== Stream Processing with Apache Kafka
In the following guide, we develop three Spring Boot applications that use Spring Cloud Stream's support for Apache Kafka and deploy
them to Cloud Foundry, to Kubernetes, and on your local machine.

=== Stream Processing with RabbitMQ
In the following guide, we develop three Spring Boot applications that use Spring Cloud Stream's support for RabbitMQ and deploy
them to Cloud Foundry, to Kubernetes, and on your local machine.

_(There is a single guide for both Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ - select the 'RabbitMQ' tabs)_.

== Summary
Congratulations! You have completed Spring Cloud Stream's high-level overview, and you were able to build and test
Spring Cloud Stream applications that communicate with RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
